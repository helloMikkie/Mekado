Headline: An urgent need for affordable housing requires the search for solutions for urban overcompression.

Text: The design concept proposes a compact housing development and develops a reduced and playful architectural form language. In particular, the design formulates responses to the essential design criteria, which seek a cost-efficient but at the same time sophisticated architectural response and therefore internalize the intended use of space as a design criterion. The central space requirements are effectively met, the consumption of space is minimized, and the building ensemble can thus be carefully inserted into the neighborhood, thus making its contribution to urban and urgently needed overcompression.
